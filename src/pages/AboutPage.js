            <p>Hello there! My name is Subin Paul.</p>
            <p>
              These are some of the photographs from my eclectic collection that
              Iâ€™ve been able to compile over the last four years or so. I am
              more of a weekend photographer than a&nbsp;professional one. My
              passion includes &nbsp;travelling a lot, meeting new people and
              places. This is a humble effort to capture&nbsp;the essence of
              human emotions, the &nbsp;ever-enticing Mother Nature and&nbsp;the
              nuances of our proud Indian culture through my lens. Last but not
              the least, I thank you all for your support. For its your
              appreciation and encouragement that &nbsp;gets me going!
            </p>
